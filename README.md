Why the hell do I provide these icons?
========

I've tried to sell these icons last year - it was a complete failure. I guess people are not interested in paying for them. This is why I've decided to open source those icons. The only thing I would ask of you, if you happen to use them, is to give me credits on your website. That's it.
