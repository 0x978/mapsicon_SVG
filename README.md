## Introduction

Mapsicon is a free collection of maps for every country in the world, available in 11 different sizes, from 16x16 pixels to 512x512 pixels.


## Technical information

Icons are in PNG-8 bits with alpha transparency (basically, the background is transparent) and are in a black (#000) color. If you need them with a specific color, we can provide it to you in 48 hours for a fixed amount. Contact me for more information.

## Optimization of the images

All the icons have been optimized to have the smallest possible size, using PNGOUT, AdvPNG, Pngcrush and OptiPNG (through ImageOptim). Basically, 1024 x 1024 icons weight around 12 KB.

## How are the maps named?

The maps are named after the official two-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166-1. Basically, that means the United States are named US, Canada is named CA - you get it.

## Are some countries omitted?

Some countries have been intentionally omitted, either because they have no official maps yet or because they are islands that are so small that they can not be drawn. The omitted countries are Micronesia, Jersey, Marshall Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Palestinia, Tuvalu and United States Minor Outlying Islands.

Why the hell do I provide these icons?
========

I've tried to sell these icons last year - it was a complete failure. I guess people are not interested in paying for them. This is why I've decided to open source those icons. The only thing I would ask of you, if you happen to use them, is to give me credits on your website. That's it.

Some help
========

If you need to access all those countries programmatically, here is a gist containing all the countries as well as their ISO code: https://gist.github.com/djaiss/2938259
