Fork of https://github.com/djaiss/mapsicon

Just extracted all SVG's into a single file, where each is named after their 2 letter IBAN country code, programatically.

From what I can tell, the following countries are missing, and will need to be included manually:

`"Jersey","Marshall Islands","Micronesia, Federated States Of","Netherlands Antilles","Northern Mariana Islands","Palestinian Territory, Occupied","Tuvalu","United States Outlying Islands"`
